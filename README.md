# What is the most performant/sustainable open source LRS in 2023?

## Abstract

Choosing the appropriate Learning Record Store can be challenging: getting an unbiased comparison of their performance and energy efficiency is complex.
For this matter, FUN is developing LBT, an open source benchmarking tool serving two purposes:
- benchmark performance and sustainability of open source LRS, and publish the results periodically;
- offer a continuous integration testing tool to help LRS teams improve their LRS performance.
